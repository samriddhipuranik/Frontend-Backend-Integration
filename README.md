# Frontend-Backend Integration For Dummies

This project serves as an example for anyone who encounter difficulties integrating frontend and backend components in web development projects. It demonstrates a simple setup using JavaScript for the frontend and Express.js for the backend, along with MySQL as the database.

## Description

Many developers face challenges when trying to connect frontend user interfaces with backend server logic. This project aims to provide a clear and straightforward example to help developers overcome these hurdles.

## Features

- **Frontend Form Submission**: The project includes a basic HTML form where users can input their name and email address.
- **Backend Server**: Express.js is used to create a simple backend server that handles incoming requests.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL is used as the database backend to store form data submitted by users.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: The backend server is configured with CORS to allow cross-origin requests from the frontend.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend-backend-integration.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend-backend-integration/frontend
   npm install

   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

4. Open the frontend in your browser:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   open index.html
   ```

5. Fill out the form and submit it. You should see a success message upon successful form submission.
